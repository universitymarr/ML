### Homework1

Project development

1. Solve the two classification problems: **A) optimization prediction, B) compiler prediction**.
   
    For each classification problem, realize at least two variants (varying feature extraction, learning algorithm, learning hyper-parameters, etc.).
Note: Use any method at your choice, except neural networks.

2. Evaluate each variant in a proper way. Find the best model and motivate the choice.
   
3. For each classification problem, apply the best model to predict output for the blind test set.
   
4. Write a report (about 10 pages) explaining all the work done: design and implementation choices, evaluation procedure and results. Reports must be individual.

*Run the file with Google Colab, using the GPU. It's free.*

### Homework2

Project development

1. Solve the image classification problem in two modes: **A) define a CNN and train it from scratch, B) apply transfer learning and fine tuning from a pre-trained model.**
For training you can use any subset of the MWI dataset.

2. Evaluate the two models in a proper way. Discuss the best model and motivate the choice. Testing can be done either with cross-validation on MWI or with the SMART-I weather test set.
   
3. Write a report (about 10 pages) explaining all the work done: design and implementation choices, evaluation procedure and results. Reports must be individual.
   
4. Submit a set of images to be used to define a new test set
   
5. Submit your best model (layout and weights)

**Here we have 2 files, because a training was done on a standard dataset and the other on an external one that was provided to us in a seminar.**
